            It is a programming language that is used to give the web
            application structure.

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The h1 element is used to indicate the most important (or
            highest-level) heading on the page.
            <ul>
              <li>
                In total, we have six heading levels to choose from—h1 to h6—to

            Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or
            declarations, will apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we
            want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the
            declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the
            value for that property, blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "img" selector: assigns property values to any image element in
            the markup.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The display property is assigned with the block value, which
                assigns each image to start on a new line.

            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.

            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside

            git add: The git add command adds a change in the working directory

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that
            allows users to interact with websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reason the "script" element is placed near the bottom of the
            HTML file is that the browser reads code in the order it appears in
            the file.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the
                HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing
                JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to
                accommodate this dependency.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon ;</li>
          <li>
            Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a
            variable with the "let" keyword, followed by the name you give to
            the variable:
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables may hold values that have different "data type"s
            <ul>
              <li>
                Strings:This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify
                that the value is a string, enclose it in double or single quote
                marks. Ex: let myVariable = "Bob";
              </li>
              <li>
                Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.
                Ex:let myVariable = 10;
              </li>
              <li>
                Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false
                are special keywords that don't need quote marks. Ex: let
                myVariable = true;
              </li>
              <li>
                Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple
                values in a single reference. Ex:let myVariable =
                [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
              </li>
              <li>
                Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an
                object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you
                learn.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression
            returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the
            "if,else, and else if"
            <ul>
              <li>
                The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values
                are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are
                equal and false if the values are not equal.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to
            reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that
            executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a
            good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Functions often take "Arguments": bits of data they need to do
              their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by
              commas if there is more than one argument.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we
            call an "arrow function". An "arrow function" uses () => instead of
            function ():
          </li>
          <li>`const`: means that the identifier can't be reassigned</li>
          <li>
            The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of an integer
            division
          </li>
          <li>
            Array: a built-in global object that allows you to store multiple
            elements at once.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Index: the location of the data item in the array. This location
                is identified with a unique number.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the
                first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                To access a specific index in an array, you would start by
                typing the name of the array, followed by the index in square
                brackets. Ex: Array[1]
              </li>
              <li>
                Length: We can find the length of an array by using a built-in
                property of an array, appropriately named length. Ex:
                array.length
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            For loop: A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to
            perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single
            code block to be executed over and over.
            <ul>
              <li>
                A for loop contains the following three important statements:
              </li>
              <ol class="indent">
                <li>
                  The first statement determines the starting point for our
                  loop.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second statement is the condition. As long as the number
                  in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the
                  loop will keep running.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over
                  each item. Often this increments the value of the initial
                  variable. This is not always the case. JavaScript doesn't
                  care. This is optional.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Function: is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer
            how to perform a certain task.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order for the code inside a function to run, we need to call the
            function.
          </li>
        </ul>
