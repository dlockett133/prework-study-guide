          <li>HMTL means Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>
            It is a programming language that is used to give the web
            application structure.
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The h1 element is used to indicate the most important (or
            highest-level) heading on the page.
            <ul>
              <li>
                In total, we have six heading levels to choose from—h1 to h6—to
                add structure to the web page

            Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or
            declarations, will apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we
            want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the
            declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the
            value for that property, blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "img" selector: assigns property values to any image element in
            the markup.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The display property is assigned with the block value, which
                assigns each image to start on a new line.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.

            git add: The git add command adds a change in the working directory
            to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates
            to a particular file in the next commit.
          </li>
          <li>
            git commit -m: A commit is a snapshot of your Git repository

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that
            allows users to interact with websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reason the "script" element is placed near the bottom of the
            HTML file is that the browser reads code in the order it appears in
            the file.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the
                HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing
                JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to
                accommodate this dependency.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a
            variable with the "let" keyword, followed by the name you give to
            the variable:
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables may hold values that have different "data type"s
            <ul>
              <li>
                Strings:This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify
                that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.
                Ex: let myVariable = 'Bob';
              </li>
              <li>
                Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.
                Ex:let myVariable = 10;
              </li>
              <li>
                Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false
                are special keywords that don't need quote marks. Ex: let
                myVariable = true;
              </li>
              <li>
                Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple
                values in a single reference. Ex:let myVariable =
                [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
              </li>
              <li>
                Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an
                object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you
                learn.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression
            returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the
            "if,else, and else if"
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to
            reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that
            executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a
            good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Functions often take "Arguments": bits of data they need to do
              their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by
              commas if there is more than one argument.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we
            call an "arrow function". An "arrow function" uses () => instead of
            function ():
          </li>
          <li>`const` means that the identifier can't be reassigned</li>
